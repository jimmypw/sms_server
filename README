SMS Server

James Park-Watt 2012 jimmypw@gmail.com

Requirements:
- A GSM device with an AT command set that runs over serial. I developed this on a Siemens TC65. I /think/ some other devices that I have used previously had the correct commands.
- An activated sim card.
- A redis server
- python
-- pyserial
-- pyredis
- Nodejs
-- redis

It works like this.

Start the redis server
Start the SMS driver. it needs to connect to the redis server.
Start the SMS-webservice. You may need to modify it a bit to get it running properly on your network.
